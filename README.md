# Typed Mermaid

<!-- > 2019-11-11T14:46:22+0800 -->

The mermaid charts may be better typed to be more flexible.

The strategy that codes generate codes is
the ~~right~~ ~~considerate~~ adventurous manner
to get kinds of tasks handled.

In other words, the mermaid syntax text,
as well as the markdown text,
should be generated instead of maintained.
